Heroes are not born, they're hatched!

Congratulations! You are now the proud owner of a pocket hero.
In a few moments, your pocket hero will hatch from their egg and
it will be up to you to nuture them to greatness!

Pocket Hero was made for the Bored Pixel Jam 8 with the Theme "You're Not the Hero"
It is a resource management "game" that is designed to be played over a long period
of time to simulate raising an alien. If you'd like, you can always adjust the 
game speed in the options menu if you don't like waiting. That said, the web version 
seems to have issues running when the game screen is not visible.
This is related to some web browsers putting the tab to sleep. If anyone knows how to
fix this in Unity, let me know! :)

Tips:
 - Babies will over eat and get an upset stomach.
 - Babies won't have enough energy if they are awoken from sleeping.
 - To grow up, a baby must have a full nutrition bar
 - To become a hero, your alien must spend as much time as possible training.
 - Each of the Training activities requires specific resources
 - Each food provides bonuses to Nutrition, Saturation, Strength, Speed, and Intelligence
 - A hero in training will only recover energy if they are saturated
